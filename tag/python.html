                        <p>Hi guys how are you? I hope all of you are fine. Recently I was working on a PyQt project. The project was <a href="">youtube-dl-GUI</a>.

                        <p>Recently I've started learning about Kivy, a Python Natural User Interface (NUI) toolkit. As I understand it, Kivy is kind of a spiritual successor to <a href="http://pymt.eu/">pyMT</a>, which you can read more about <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/faq.html#how-is-kivy-related-to-pymt">here</a>. In this article, we will be learning how Kivy handles layout management. While you can position ...</p>

post about testing in python. Testing is one of the most important part
